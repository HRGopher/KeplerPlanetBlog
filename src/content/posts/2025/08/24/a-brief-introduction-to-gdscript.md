GDScript is the primary scripting language for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). It is a high-level, dynamically typed language that is very similar to Python. Its syntax is designed to be clean and easy to read, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Key Features

*   **Python-like Syntax:** If you are familiar with Python, you will feel right at home with GDScript.
*   **Integrated with Godot:** GDScript is deeply integrated with the Godot editor, providing a seamless development experience with features like code completion and built-in documentation.
*   **Designed for Games:** GDScript is specifically designed for game development, with built-in types for vectors, colors, and other common game development data structures.

## Example

Here is a simple example of a GDScript file that makes a character jump:

```gdscript
# player.gd
extends KinematicBody2D

var velocity = Vector2.ZERO
const JUMP_FORCE = -400
const GRAVITY = 1000

func _physics_process(delta):
    velocity.y += GRAVITY * delta

    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump"):
        velocity.y = JUMP_FORCE

    velocity = move_and_slide(velocity, Vector2.UP)
```

This script defines the behavior of a player character, including gravity and jumping. It's a great example of how GDScript can be used to quickly prototype game mechanics.
